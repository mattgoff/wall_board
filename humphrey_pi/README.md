# Humphrey's Lap Counter

To my sons hamster wheel I attached a small neodymium magnet.  Then to the side of the cage a hall
affect sensor was mounted.  Wired to pin 17 of a Raspberry Pi, it will record the number of laps
over a 24 hour period.  At 7am the number of laps ran are uploaded to Thingspeak.

One revolution of the wheel = 63.5cm, this and the number of laps allows nightly travel distance
to be calculated.
